/**
 * 957. Prison Cells After N Days
 * Medium
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * There are 8 prison cells in a row and each cell is either occupied or vacant.
 *
 * Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:
 *
 * If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
 * Otherwise, it becomes vacant.
 * Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.
 *
 * You are given an integer array cells where cells[i] == 1 if the ith cell is occupied and cells[i] == 0 if the ith cell is vacant, and you are given an integer n.
 *
 * Return the state of the prison after n days (i.e., n such changes described above).
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], n = 7
 * Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
 * Explanation: The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
 * Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
 * Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
 * Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
 * Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
 * Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
 * Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
 * Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
 * Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], n = 1000000000
 * Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * cells.length == 8
 * cells[i] is either 0 or 1.
 * 1 <= n <= 109
