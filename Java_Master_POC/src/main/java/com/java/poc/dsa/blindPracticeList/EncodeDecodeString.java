 * Description
 * Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.
 *
 * Please implement encode and decode
 *
 * Because the string may contain any of the 256 legal ASCII characters, your algorithm must be able to handle any character that may appear
 *
 * Do not rely on any libraries, the purpose of this problem is to implement the "encode" and "decode" algorithms on your own
 *
 * Example
 * Example1
 *
 * Input: ["lint","code","love","you"]
 * Output: ["lint","code","love","you"]
 * Explanation:
 * One possible encode method is: "lint:;code:;love:;you"
 * Example2
 *
 * Input: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
 * Output: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
 * Explanation:
 * One possible encode method is: "we:;say:;:::;yes"
